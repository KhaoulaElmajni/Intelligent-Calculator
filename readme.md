## <span style="color:blue "> 1.Project Presentation</span>:paperclip:
* <strong style="color:dark">This project is a Scientific Calculator,that any body can use it for counting a standard operations, or smart operations.
* <strong style="color:dark">Also some other functionalities that are new in calculators.

# <span style="color:green">2.Technologies Used</span>:pushpin:
 #### <span style="color:#0036ad"> 1.JAVA Language:</span>
 * <strong style="color:dark">Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

*see also* [JAVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
#### <span style="color:#0036ad"> 2.SWING class:</span>
 * <strong style="color:dark">Java Swing is a lightweight Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit that includes a rich set of widgets. It includes package lets you make GUI components for your Java applications, and It is platform independent.
 * <strong style="color:dark">The Swing library is built on top of the Java Abstract Widget Toolkit (AWT), an older, platform dependent GUI toolkit. You can use the Java GUI components like button, textbox, etc. from the library and do not have to create the components from scratch.
*see also* [SWING](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html)
#### <span style="color:#0036ad"> 3.AWT class:</span>
 * <strong style="color:dark">Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop GUI or window-based applications in java.

Java AWT components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of operating system. AWT is heavyweight i.e. its components are using the resources of OS.

The java.awt package provides classes for AWT api such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List etc.
